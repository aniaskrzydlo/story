This is a story of a frustrated R dev,
who received an email right before the weekend.
He checked the task as requested
and assigned it to his unhappy-self.
He spent the whole weekend hard at work
and finished just before the Client call.
Sleepy and tired, but ready to shine,
he received a text from the Client.
It's not a true story, but we've all been there.

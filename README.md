# Story of a frustrated R developer
Link to the deployed application: https://aniaskrzydlo.shinyapps.io/story/

### About
This is an application created for the [Shiny Contest 2021](https://blog.rstudio.com/2021/03/11/time-to-shiny/) organized by RStudio. The idea was to use Shiny in a creative way and to create something that is not native to Shiny - a story.

The UI is built with [shiny.fluent](https://appsilon.github.io/shiny.fluent/).

### How to use
Read the story and interact as you were the frustrated developer, i.e. if there is an email - open it.
